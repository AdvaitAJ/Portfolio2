           Hello there!  My name is Advait Jagannathan and I am pursuing a career in the computer sciences.  I currently attend Dublin High School and am enrolled in AP computer science, where we are learning different coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and PYTHON, along with learning the inner workings of the internet.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           I have been running for four years on a club, and am now running with the Dublin High School cross country team.  I believe my experiances with running have taught me how to perservere through trials and tribulations.  Running has also gave me a greater sense of responsibilty by placing myself with the pressure to follow through with runs by myself over off season in order to stay in shape.  Both of these attributes contribute to me being able to perform in a working enviorment, whether having the perserverance to work over long hours getting the job done, or possesing the responsibility to get work done in a timly manner and error free.  
          </p>
           <br>
          <p>
            I am a very dependable person, and have proven time and time again in group oriented discussions or projects that I am able to not only lead a group, but know which positions to give to certain people. On top of that, I am quite responsible and always dedicated to a task.  When I put my mind to something, it will get done to the best of my ability no matter what.  I believe these talents would be perfect in a working enviorment as they are all skills that push me in tasks, and would cause me to thrive when working.
