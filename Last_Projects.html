              <h2>The Right Skin</h2>
              <h6>SEPTEMBER 28-29, 2019</h6>
              <p>Attended a 24 hour hackathon where I, along with two other teamates, made a website to inform people of the dangers of skin care products and how to choose the correct brands based on certain facial needs one may have, while also taking into consideration the enviormental impact of these products.
              <br><br>
              During this project the main thing I learned was how to work succesfully in a tight window of time.  We could not prepare any information prior to the hackathon, meaning we had 24 hours to think of a project, make the website, and make a presentation to present to the rest of the people there.  This mean we had to act fast and practically in order to suceed.
              <br><br>
              The judges had very good things to say about our project, such as how at the time they thought "this is a very creative idea, since there are not many websites that compile information of all different types of skin products", additionally noting how they "liked how your project focused on health and wellness but also incorporated environmental impact".
              <br><br>
              Our code contained around 138 lines of HTML and javascript combined, along with 270 lines of CSS

              <h2>DVC Intro to web design</h2>
              <h6>2020</h6>
              <p>During the college course introduction to web design, we were given our own websites which we used to complete assingments, midterms, and finals.  All on the website is coded manually.
              <br><br>
              During this large project, I was able to grasp a much better concept of the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.  I was able to finish the course with a 100.53% showing my capability to suceed in HTML coding. These projects also taught me the skill of debugging, as countless times a screen wouldn't look the way I wanted it to and would then have to read through my code to find my error.
              <br><br>
              Combining all of the different screens in the 1 website, this website has over 850 lines of HTML coding all written by me.

              <h2>DVC app dev</h2>
              <h6>2020</h6>
              <p>Took part in the college course ipad and iphone app devlopment, where using swift and xcode we made multiple different apps for different purposes, exploting different functions to learn from in each assignment.
              <br><br>
              On the right, this is a project where we had to build a table with presets of different types of food for a resturant. Using the correct swift code and UI I was able to complete said project.

              <h2>Running Website</h2>
              <h6>November 2019</h6>
              <p>When just starting coding, a fellow runner and I teamed up to make this website for fun.  We decided to make an informative website about the most commmon types of running injuries, and how to avoid them.  We also discussed different archs and the dangers of running with the wrong type of shoe.
              <br><br>
              A lot of functions in this website I did not know prior to making, showing how much of a learning experiance this project was.  I also learnt that creating a website for the fun of it instead of for schoolwork leads to me being more creative and passionate about my work.
              <br><br>
              This website contained more then 150 lines of code in HTML, and nearly 100 in CSS </p>
